## Spell and feat changes

Redemption has had several [changes to spells](spell-changes) and [changes to feats](feat-changes) with the goal of improving PvP balance.

TODO: Check if the following is still true!

## Skill changes

In addition to the changes linked above, the way two skills are gained has changed:


{% blockquote %}
Players may only take their highest bard/rogue/assassin level + 3 ranks in UMD.
{% endblockquote %}

For example, a multiclassed fighter/rogue with 18 levels of fighter and 2 levels of rogue may only take 5 ranks in UMD. Player characters (PCs) that have taken more than the allowed ranks will be automatically deleveled, then over 95% of the lost experience points will be restored.

{% blockquote %}
PCs with bard levels may only take their bard level + 3 ranks in tumble. Tumble is not restricted for any other classes.
{% endblockquote %}

For example, a multiclassed bard/pale master with 16 levels of pale master and 4 levels of bard may only take 7 ranks in tumble. PCs that have taken more than the allowed ranks will be automatically deleveled, then over 95% of the lost experience points will be restored.
