## General Overview

Redemption Reloaded makes available three alignment based Clans that players may choose to join:

* Eclipse - Good
* Chimaera - Neutral
* Kindred - Evil

Player held positions of **Leader**, **Recruiter** and **Champion** represent each clan.

The purpose of a clan is to enhance game play and players may leave a clan by choice or, the clan may opt to terminate your membership.

Clans are charged with governing a **Great Hall** and to aid them, are protected by a **Moat** in which **Clan Goons** reside.

Goons are native to Dominia and favor the appropriate clan based on their general demeanor, attacking all others not affiliated with the Clan. Their races are as varied as the citizens of Dominia itself and as such, inherit specific abilities as they mature.

Members of each Clan are responsible for maintaining and upgrading their minions and halls through the spoils of their adventures.

## Clan Uprades

### Minions

Clans receive 1 Moat Goon to start. Goons within clan halls may also be purchased and are designated as **banker**, **merchant** and **healer**. A maximum of 4 moat and 3 hall minions may exist. Total class levels for any minion cannot exceed 80 with no more than 30 in a prestige class and no more than 2 prestige classes.

* Immunity feats are not allowed
* Devastating Critical is not allowed
* Sap is not allowed

Goons must follow all standard character development, restrictions and class level requirements when gaining feats, skills or weapon/item usage and do not acquire any feats, ability or other increases when gaining a level. This means giving a goon a level of fighter does not automatically grant them hit points, feats, skills etc. typically associated with that class level. It also means that if a feat requires a level in a specific class, the goon must meet that class requirement.

Goons will automatically acquire innate abilities/visuals at levels 53, 66 and 80 based on phenotype. Each clans goons phenotype with the abilities/visuals earned as they progress are predetermined and applied in addition to any abilities that may have been purchased.

{% blockquote %}
All goons start as a Commoner with default skills and abilities. The Commoner class offers no benefits to the goons but acts as a placeholder separate from any other class. Example classes include, but are not limited to, Ooze, Giant, Undead, Commoner, Monk, Druid, Animal, Vermin, etc. Only the NWN Player versions of classes may be taken.
{% endblockquote %}

You upgrade your goons how you want, following the building restrictions and costs. This means, if you want your goon to have Cleave, they need to first meet the prerequisites (Power Attack/Strength 13+). As you build your goons and level them, you will request classes. These class-levels will replace the already existing Commoner ones. Example, if I take 4 fighter levels, my goon will be level 4 fighter, level 36 commoner. Only those feats that do not have a class requirement, can be assigned to a goon with nothing but a Commoner class assigned.
