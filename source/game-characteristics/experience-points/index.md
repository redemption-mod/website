Experience is based on two things; Monster Challenge Rating and PC Level.

Maximum XP is gained when the PC level is within a specific range of monster CR (not too high, not too low). You can tell if you are within this IDEAL RANGE, by right clicking on a monster and choosing the EXAMINE option. You will note a color and classification.

Here are the ratings and XP potential:
* <span class="purple">Purple - Impossible</span>: Ok to excellent XP (5 or more levels higher)
* <span class="red">Red - Overpowering</span>: Ideal XP (3 or 4 levels higher)
* <span class="orange">Orange - Very Difficult</span>: Ok XP (1 or 2 levels higher)
* <span class="yellow">Yellow - Challenging</span>: Poor XP (same or 1 level lower)
* <span class="blue">Blue - Moderate</span>: Crappy XP (2 or 3 levels lower)
* <span class="green">Green - Easy</span>: Kick him to the curb (4 or 5 levels lower)
* <span class="white">White - Effortless</span>: Not worth the edge of your blade (6 or more levels lower)

Redemption also incorporates Party Experience. This affects the base XP as follows:

When the party size in an area is 7 or less, and the maximum levels between each player is 9 or less, take the average XP a single payer would normally get, multiplied by (result of 20 + 2 x the number of PCs in area) then multiplied by (result of the number of PCs in area divided by 100).

Finally, Redemption Reloaded has Zone Notices (signs) posted in almost all monster areas. These signs give you the PC level range required to maximize XP AND defeat the monsters without dying so be on the lookout!
