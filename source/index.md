Hello everyone, and welcome to the **Redemption Reloaded** website.

As you can see, the site is currently under construction and many menu items do not work yet.

As an example of the feel/functionality of the site we would want/expect, look at the following parts:

* [Game characteristics - PvP](game-characteristics/player-vs-player/)
* [Spell changes - spell changes](game-changes/spell-changes/)

Obviously while the general styling is done, the custom pages (like the spell changes page) are not 100% done yet (need to style the buttons, search, ... ), but I wanted to get it out to get some feedback.

If you have any comments, don't hesitate to let me know!
